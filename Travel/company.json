This provides good prerequisites on both the clean hydrogen generation side as well as providing a testing ground for lighthouse projects on the application side, with a complementing value chain available in the region.  \n\nBased on the report findings, the TPOs have agreed on the potential to formalize the collaboration going forward, as one of the carefully selected industries of collaboration.\n\nWe extend our warmest thanks to the +35 companies and organisations who shared their perspective with us during the conducting of the study!\n\n#Hydrogen #NordicCollaboration",

This provides good prerequisites on both the clean hydrogen generation side as well as providing a testing ground for lighthouse projects on the application side, with a complementing value chain available in the region.  \n\nBased on the report findings, the TPOs have agreed on the potential to formalize the collaboration going forward, as one of the carefully selected industries of collaboration.\n\nWe extend our warmest thanks to the +35 companies and organisations who shared their perspective with us during the conducting of the study!\n\n#Hydrogen #NordicCollaboration",

This provides good prerequisites on both the clean hydrogen generation side as well as providing a testing ground for lighthouse projects on the application side, with a complementing value chain available in the region.  \n\nBased on the report findings, the TPOs have agreed on the potential to formalize the collaboration going forward, as one of the carefully selected industries of collaboration.\n\nWe extend our warmest thanks to the +35 companies and organisations who shared their perspective with us during the conducting of the study!\n\n#Hydrogen #NordicCollaboration",

He added: “From Business Sweden’s side, we are keen to see further exchange and collaboration between leading digitalisation countries such as Sweden and Ireland and our companies. \n\nThis message was reinforced by Minister Slottner: “In an interconnected world it is important that our critical digital infrastructure is robust and resilient.

This event, held in Gothenburg and Mölndal on 10-11 September, included cooperation with BIHES and Baltic district heating associations. BIHES (Baltic Innovative Hybrid Energy System) is a project co-funded by the Swedish Institute under the SI Baltic Sea Neighbourhood Programme. Over 70 stakeholders from Estonia, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the UK, and Sweden attended to explore Swedish solutions combining heat pumps, CHP, and DH networks.\n\nThe tour provided participants to visit Krokslätt Energy System and Gothenburg Energy's Heat Pump Plant, along with presentations from over 15 SHC member companies. Key aspects highlighted included:\n\n- Enhanced Energy Efficiency: Integration of heat pumps with renewable sources like biofuels and waste heat recovery improves efficiency and reduces CO2 emissions.\n- Scalability of Heat Pump Solutions: Versatility from large-scale systems to smaller applications addresses diverse energy needs.\n- Innovative System Design: Advanced designs optimise heat distribution and energy use with sophisticated control systems.\n- Collaborative Approaches: Emphasis on partnerships between public authorities, energy companies, users, and technology providers.\n- Asset Management: Solutions for smart asset management, including predictive maintenance and leak prevention.\n- Future Trends and Opportunities: Emerging trends like AI for system optimisation and district cooling integration.\n\nWe encourage continued dialogue and thank all participants and partners for their engagement. Stay connected via the Sustainable Heating & Cooling by Sweden (SHC by Sweden).",

      "description": "Within the Sustainable Heating & Cooling by Sweden (SHC by Sweden) program, Business Sweden, The Swedish Energy Agency International and SweHeat organised a two-day study tour on heat pumps in district heating networks. This event, held in Gothenburg and Mölndal on 10-11 September, included cooperation with BIHES and Baltic district heating associations. BIHES (Baltic Innovative Hybrid Energy System) is a project co-funded by the Swedish Institute under the SI Baltic Sea Neighbourhood Programme. Over 70 stakeholders from Estonia, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the UK, and Sweden attended to explore Swedish solutions combining heat pumps, CHP, and DH networks.\n\nThe tour provided participants to visit Krokslätt Energy System and Gothenburg Energy's Heat Pump Plant, along with presentations from over 15 SHC member companies. Key aspects highlighted included:\n\n- Enhanced Energy Efficiency: Integration of heat pumps with renewable sources like biofuels and waste heat recovery improves efficiency and reduces CO2 emissions.\n- Scalability of Heat Pump Solutions: Versatility from large-scale systems to smaller applications addresses diverse energy needs.\n- Innovative System Design: Advanced designs optimise heat distribution and energy use with sophisticated control systems.\n- Collaborative Approaches: Emphasis on partnerships between public authorities, energy companies, users, and technology providers.\n- Asset Management: Solutions for smart asset management, including predictive maintenance and leak prevention.\n- Future Trends and Opportunities: Emerging trends like AI for system optimisation and district cooling integration.\n\nWe encourage continued dialogue and thank all participants and partners for their engagement. Stay connected via the Sustainable Heating & Cooling by Sweden (SHC by Sweden).",

Brilliantly chaired by Innovation Professor Martin Curley, discussions covered key topics such as the importance of standardised data integration, the need for policy reforms and streamlined processes to foster the growth of digital health initiatives. \n\n• Net Zero Business Forum: following a presentation on Ireland’s Net-Zero Transformation at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Climate and Communication, participants at the Net Zero Business Forum identified opportunities for further Swedish-Irish collaboration and partnerships for innovation, such as sustainable transport, wind and heat networks. In a wide-ranging discussion expertly moderated by Assistant Secretary Gary Tobin at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the need for government policy, access to sustainable energy and efficiency was emphasized, as well as the importance of consumer adoption of new technologies and skills. \n\nAstraZeneca, Getinge, Ericsson, Alfa Laval, STENA LINE (UK) LIMITED, Volvo Bus UK & Ireland, SIEMENS GAMESA RENEWABLE ENERGY AB, Saab, Volvo Cars, IKEA",

This time a special comprehensive edition -  Lessons from 2024 & The Road to 2025.\n\nKey Insights from the report:\n• 2024 marked a year of stagnating EV sales in Europe & the U.S.:\nWhile China remains the dominant EV market, stricter regulations, low EV margins, and shifting subsidies are reshaping the EU and US landscape. What could boost the EV demand in 2025 and what regulatory updates can we expect?\n\n• Heavy-duty electrification progresses, but grid capacity remains a challenge:\nWith major players like Volvo Group and Scania Group expanding their electric truck offerings, we are getting close to cost of ownership parity with diesel counterparts, but can investments in high-power charging networks keep up?\n\nRead more and access the latest report here: https://brnw.ch/21wRgSs\n\n#Electrification #EVs #EnergyTransition #Sustainability #BatteryTech #HeavyDuty",

This time a special comprehensive edition -  Lessons from 2024 & The Road to 2025.\n\nKey Insights from the report:\n• 2024 marked a year of stagnating EV sales in Europe & the U.S.:\nWhile China remains the dominant EV market, stricter regulations, low EV margins, and shifting subsidies are reshaping the EU and US landscape.
